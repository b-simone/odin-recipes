        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>A Moscow mule is a cocktail made with vodka, spicy ginger beer, and lime juice, garnished with a slice or wedge of lime. 
           It is a type of buck; therefore, sometimes called a vodka buck. The Moscow mule is popularly served in a copper mug, which
           takes on the cold temperature of the liquid. Due to the popularity of the Moscow mule, other buck cocktails with different
           liquors have been labeled with the "mule" name in recent years.</p>
