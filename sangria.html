        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Sangria is an alcoholic beverage originating in Spain and Portugal. Under EU regulations only those two Iberian nations can label their product as Sangria;
           similar products from different regions are differentiated in name. A punch, sangria traditionally consists of red wine and chopped fruit, often with
           other ingredients or spirits. Sangria is one of the most popular drinks in Spanish cuisine. It is commonly served in bars, restaurants, and chiringuitos
           and at festivities throughout Portugal and Spain.</p>
